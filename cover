update Cargo.lock in git-series for OpenSSL 1.1.1

Right now, git-series can only be built with OpenSSL up to 1.1.0.
This patch series updates the Cargo.lock to add checksums which
recent Cargo versions expect (and nixpkgs uses for offline builds)
and then minimally updates the dependencies so that a newer
openssl-sys crate is used.
